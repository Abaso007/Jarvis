# Jarvis
IronMan's Jarvis with python

### Run-Book:
   - Run the following commands in command line/terminal:
        - `cd lib` - Gets into the installations directory.
        - `chmod +x installs.sh` - Makes [installation file](lib/installs.sh) as executable.
        - `python3 -m venv venv` - Creates a virtual env.
        - `source venv/bin/activate` - Activates the virtual env `venv`
        - `which python` - Validate which python is being used. Should be the one within the virtual env.
        - `bash installs.sh` (`bash installs_windows.sh` for [Windows OS](https://github.com/thevickypedia/Jarvis/wiki#windows-os)) - Installs the required libraries/modules.
        - `python3 jarvis.py` - BOOM, you're all set, go ahead and interact with Jarvis
